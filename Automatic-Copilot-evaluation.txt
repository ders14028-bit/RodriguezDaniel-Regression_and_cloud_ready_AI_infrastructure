  AUTOMATIC COPILOT EVALUATION — TA Grading Report
  Course: Digital Transformation and Enterprise Architecture
  Topic:  Stellar Luminosity — Linear and Polynomial Regression
====================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The student delivered a complete and technically sound submission
covering both linear and polynomial regression from first principles
using only Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib as required. Notebook 1
walks through the full linear-regression pipeline — dataset
visualization, MSE cost, cost-surface visualization, analytic
gradient derivation, non-vectorized and vectorized gradient descent,
convergence analysis, multi-rate experiments, and a conceptual
discussion. Notebook 2 extends this to polynomial regression with
two features, implementing vectorized loss/gradients, model
comparison (M1/M2/M3), interaction-term sweep, and an inference
demo. The README provides a clear description of the work, results,
and cloud execution evidence with screenshots. Two execution bugs in
Notebook 1 (undefined variable `history` before it is assigned, and
undefined `w_learned`/`b_learned` in the final plot cell) would
prevent a clean sequential run of the notebook. Notebook 2 has a
minor issue with the w_MT sweep range being extremely narrow, leading
to an inconclusive interaction analysis. Overall, the submission
demonstrates solid understanding of the core concepts.

GRADING BREAKDOWN (0.0 – 5.0 scale)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Repository structure & compliance .................. 0.5 / 0.5
   - README.md present                                        ✓

   + Cost surface (3D grid, surface plot, explanation)        ✓  [MANDATORY]
   + Gradient derivation shown (LaTeX formulas)               ✓
   + Non-vectorized gradient descent (explicit loop)          ✓
   + Vectorized gradient descent (NumPy operations)           ✓
   + Convergence plot and discussion                          ✓  [MANDATORY]

   + Conceptual discussion (meaning of w, limits)             ✓

   Deductions (-0.4):
   - Cell 23 (convergence plot) references `history` before
     gradient_descent is ever called; would raise NameError
     if notebook is executed top-to-bottom.                  -0.2
   - Cell 30 (final fit plot) uses `w_learned` and
     `b_learned`, which are never assigned anywhere in the
     notebook; `L_hat` is from the initial test parameters,
     not the trained model. Plot would fail or show wrong
     results.                                                -0.2

3. Notebook 2 — Polynomial Regression ................. 1.75 / 2.0
   Items evaluated:
   + Scatter plot colored by temperature                      ✓
   + Feature matrix X = [M, T, M², M·T]                      ✓
   + Vectorized MSE and gradient functions                    ✓
   + Gradient-descent training and convergence plot           ✓
   + M1 / M2 / M3 model comparison with loss and plots       ✓  [MANDATORY]

   + Inference demo with interpretation                       ✓  [MANDATORY]

   Deductions (-0.25):
   - The w_MT sweep range is only ±1e-6 around the learned
     value, making the resulting curve essentially flat and
     the analysis inconclusive. A broader range (e.g., ±1 or
     exploring multiple orders of magnitude) would reveal the
     parabolic shape of the cost and a clear minimum.        -0.25

4. Cloud execution evidence (SageMaker) ............... 0.40 / 0.5
   - Description of SageMaker execution workflow              ✓

   - Brief local vs cloud comparison                          ✓ (partial)

   Deductions (-0.1):
   - The local-vs-cloud comparison is superficial ("no
     difference at all"). A more insightful comparison noting
     environment setup, dependency management, reproducibility,
     or scalability benefits would be expected.              -0.1

                                   ----------------
Final grade: 4.3 / 5.0

Status: PASS  (minimum passing grade is 3.0 / 5.0)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
STRENGTHS
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- Complete coverage of all mandatory items across both notebooks.
- Clean and readable code that adheres strictly to the allowed
  library constraint (NumPy + Matplotlib only).
- Both non-vectorized and vectorized implementations of gradient
  descent are present and clearly separated.
- The 3D cost-surface visualization in Notebook 1 is well
  constructed and correctly interpreted.
- Notebook 2 properly engineers all four features [M, T, M², M·T]
  and provides a sensible three-model comparison with visual output.
- Multiple SageMaker screenshots covering both notebooks provide
  convincing cloud-execution evidence.
- Conceptual questions in Notebook 1 are answered correctly and
  concisely.
- The README is well-structured, bilingual-friendly, and provides
  meaningful results/analysis sections for both notebooks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUES & MISSING ELEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- Notebook 1, Cell 23: `history` is referenced before
  `gradient_descent` is ever called. The function is defined in
  cells 20 and 22 (twice, identically) but never invoked between
  its definition and cell 23. This causes a NameError on sequential
  execution.
- Notebook 1, Cell 30: `w_learned` and `b_learned` are undefined.
  The trained parameters from the experiments loop (cell 27) are
  stored in `w` and `b` but not assigned to `w_learned`/`b_learned`.
  The final fit plot therefore cannot run or shows incorrect results.
- Notebook 2: The w_MT interaction sweep covers only a range of
  ±1e-6, which is far too narrow to produce a meaningful cost curve.
  The student acknowledges "no clear minimum visible" but does not
  correct the range, missing the instructional objective of the
  exercise.
- README local-vs-cloud comparison is minimal and does not address
  cloud-specific benefits (scalability, reproducibility, managed
  environments, etc.).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
TA FEEDBACK TO STUDENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Your submission covers the required concepts thoroughly and your
implementations are mathematically correct. The main areas to
address are:

1. Execution flow in Notebook 1: Before plotting the convergence
   curve (cell 23) make sure gradient_descent is actually called and
   its return value assigned to `history`. Similarly, before the
   final fit plot (cell 30) assign the trained parameters:
     w_learned, b_learned, history = gradient_descent(...)
   and use them to compute predictions.

2. Interaction sweep range in Notebook 2: Broaden the w_MT sweep to
   a range of several units (e.g., np.linspace(-1, 1, 200)) so that
   the parabolic shape of the cost curve is visible and the minimum
   can be identified and discussed.

3. Cloud comparison: Expand the README section with a few sentences
   on practical differences: how libraries are pre-installed on
   SageMaker, how compute can be scaled, and how managed notebooks
   improve reproducibility compared to a local environment.

Fixing the variable-name bugs would make the notebook fully
executable and would significantly improve the quality of the
submission.

AI-GENERATION ASSESSMENT  (NON-GRADING — informational only)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Qualitative Assessment
   Indicators suggesting AI assistance:
   - Code structure is clean, consistent, and follows textbook
     conventions with very little deviation across both notebooks.
   - Function signatures and variable names are highly regular
     (predict, compute_cost, compute_gradients, gradient_descent).
   - Markdown explanations are concise and uniformly structured,
     with no visible trial-and-error or reflection on failed
     attempts.
   - The LaTeX gradient derivation (cell 15) is presented without
     intermediate steps or personal annotation.

   Indicators suggesting human authorship:
   - Explanations are written in Spanish and contain idiomatic
     phrasing (e.g., "tazas de fusion", "desenso por gradiante")
     including minor spelling errors that are characteristic of
     human typing.
   - The execution bugs (undefined `history`, `w_learned`,
     `b_learned`) are typical of a student reorganizing cells
     without re-running, rather than a fully generated notebook.
   - The narrow w_MT sweep range suggests a human oversight rather
     than an AI-generated complete solution.
   - The README includes personal remarks and a thank-you note to
     the professor.

B. Quantitative Estimate
   Code:                 ~55%  AI-assisted
   Explanations/markdown: ~35%  AI-assisted
   README:               ~25%  AI-assisted

C. Commentary
   The code in both notebooks is structurally clean and follows
   standard implementations that are widely available in tutorials
   and could have been scaffolded with AI assistance, though the
   execution bugs and the suboptimal sweep range suggest the student
   made their own editing decisions. The Spanish-language
   explanations show personal voice and contain natural imperfections
   that point to genuine authorship, with possible AI support for
   phrasing or translation. The README reads largely as original
   student writing.

   This assessment is observational and does not imply misconduct.
